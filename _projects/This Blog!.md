This blog was created using a free Jekyll theme from [Youssef Raafat](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry). It's repository can be found [here](https://github.com/YoussefRaafatNasry/portfolYOU). My goal was to find a theme which was minimal in design, not overloaded with animations and worked on Github Pages.

My goal is not to become a web developer or to extensively learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) performs much of they heavy lifting for me. I write markdown and use the theme to create elements such as lists, figures, images, videos, code and etc. If I need anything that is not offered by the combination of Markdown or the Jekyll Theme then I only need to do a google search to find the required html or css code to accomplish the goal.

If you're interested in creating your own blog then don't hesitate to visit the links above. I went from no knowledge at all regarding Jekyll to a full website on my localhost within 5 minutes!
